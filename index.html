                    Happy birthday Anjali, I know bad things happen for you on this day but here is one good thing hopefully.
                </h2>
                <br>
                <h2> You told me multiple times that you wanted a home. Well, I did not have the time it would take to build you an actual home, but I did have to time to build a city for you. This is a corner of the internet that forever belongs to you now. And it will always be here.</h2>
                <br><h2> Before we go to your city I have some things to say. First, If you are confused about why I did this, whatever reason you come up with is fine by me. Perhaps this was a passion project. Perhaps you are a special person. Perhaps I am a bit crazy. All are equally good reasons.</h2>
                <p>
                <h2> Second, here are some interesting facts about you since you were born (which you might not know).</h2>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <l style="align-self: center;">
                    <li style="font-size:25px;">You've spent 2,437 days of your life asleep.</li>
                    <li style="font-size:25px;">There are 1,413,511,077 more people on Earth than when you were born.</li>
                    <li style="font-size:25px;">The moon has orbited you 267 times in your lifetime.</li>
                    <li style="font-size:25px;">Like most things, the moon is moving away too. It moved 76 cm away since you were born.</li>
                    </l>

                <p>
                    <h2>And now we are ready to go to your city Anjali, but keep a few things in mind.</h2>
                    <l style="align-self: center;">
                        <li style="font-size:25px;">Everything in the city is clickable, so remember to click.</li>
                        <li style="font-size:25px;">Clicking on the same thing may take you to different places.</li>
                        <li style="font-size:25px;">There are a lot of places to go to, so take your time.</li>
                        </l>
